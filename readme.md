## **react-cards**

A multiplayer playing cards engine built on React and Websockets

Live demo: http://boxofcards-g1derekl.rhcloud.com/

Cards made interactive with [Interact.js](http://interactjs.io/)

What works:

 - Creating and connecting to room
 - Moving cards around on the surface
 - Flipping (showing/hiding) cards
 - Live list of connected clients

To do:

 - Put moved card on top of pile
 - Group cards and allow multiple-select and move
 - Easily shuffle cards
 - Position-based POV (players see board differently based on their seating position)
 - Hidden hands (special area for each player where only they can see cards)
 - Chat
 - More to come
