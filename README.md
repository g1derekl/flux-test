react-cards
=========

A simple card game engine, testing out the capabilities of Facebook's Flux architecture.

To run:

- Run ```npm install``` then ```grunt``` in the project's root directory to compile javascript dependencies.
- Open ```index.html``` in your favorite browser.

All you can do at this point is click on a card to move it to the table (aka discard pile). Graphics, rules and stuff to come.

To make changes, keep an instance of ```grunt watch``` running to compile your files on the fly.
